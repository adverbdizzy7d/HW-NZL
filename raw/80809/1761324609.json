{"type":"HOSTEL","name":"The Attic Backpackers","nameEN":"The Attic Backpackers","isActive":true,"isNew":false,"description":"Auckland’s Top-Floor Favourite\r\nAttic opened in 2013 and has quietly become one of the most-loved hostels in the city. We’ve welcomed over 100,000 guests from more than 140 countries (yes, we counted), and average a 9/10 rating after 6500+ reviews.\r\n\r\nWe’re perched on the top floor of a heritage building in the heart of Auckland’s CBD, near the Sky Tower, Queen Street, and everything else you’ll need on your first few days in New Zealand. With 100+ beds spread across dorms and private rooms, we’re big enough to be social but small enough to feel personal. We keep things clean, calm, and well-run — and we’ve picked up a few Hostelworld awards along the way, including Most Popular Hostel in Auckland.\r\n\r\nWhoever you are, and wherever you come from — you’re welcome here.\r\nWe believe the most important part of any hostel isn’t the building, the bunks, or even the location — it’s the people. The travellers, the staff, the shared stories and small kindnesses that make you feel at home, even when you’re far from it.\r\n‍\r\n“He aha te mea nui o te ao?\u2028He tangata, he tangata, he tangata.”\u2028\r\n— Māori proverb\r\n\r\n\u2028(What is the most important thing in the world?

Normal checkout applies and bags still need to be left in the bag room.\r\n\r\nAttic's cleaning and housekeeping teams work between 8.30 AM and 2 PM to ensure all guests can enjoy a clean hostel and rooms. Please help our team by checking out on time and letting them clean each area quickly and efficiently eg the kitchen is closed for cleaning between 10-12 noon. We work hard to ensure all guests can enjoy a clean hostel by 2.30 pm checkin time.

Guests aged 10-18 will not be permitted to share dormitories with persons other than the members of their booking party. Guests aged 10-18 must be accompanied by a responsible adult (Aged 25+) at all times.\r\nAll guests are encouraged to keep the hostel safe and secure for fellow guests.\r\n\r\nAttic is a social but not a party hostel and quiet time after 11 PM is requested in the hostel so other guests can sleep. As such, we do allow a social drink of BYO alcohol to be consumed on site but please consume responsibly, follow the House Rules and/or the requirements of Attic Team Members when prompted.\r\nNo curfew applies and there are plenty of local bars and entertainment areas nearby due to our CBD location.\r\n\r\nAttic is proud of our close relationship with Hostelworld and we look forward to hosting you.","checkin":{"from":14,"until":23},"latestCheckout":"10:00","policies":["TAXESINCLUDED"],"cancellationPolicy":{"canxDays":3,"freeCancellationEnabled":true}},"taxes":[],"hoscars":{"awards":[{"year":2025,"other":"Oceania","place":5,"otherLabel":"Continent","key":"HOSCARCONTINENTWINNER","priority":8},{"year":2019,"other":"Auckland","place":1,"otherLabel":"City","key":"HOSCARMOSTPOPULAR","priority":10},{"year":2018,"other":"Auckland","place":1,"otherLabel":"City","key":"HOSCARMOSTPOPULAR","priority":10},{"year":2017,"other":"Auckland","place":1,"otherLabel":"City","key":"HOSCARMOSTPOPULAR","priority":10},{"year":2016,"other":"Auckland","place":1,"otherLabel":"City","key":"HOSCARMOSTPOPULAR","priority":10}],"nominations":[]},"facilities":[{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYFREE","id":1,"facilities":[{"id":90,"name":"FREEWIFI"},{"id":103,"name":"FREEINTERNETACCESS"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYGENERAL","id":2,"facilities":[{"id":113,"name":"JOBSBOARD"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYSERVICES","id":3,"facilities":[{"id":15,"name":"LUGGAGESTORAGE"},{"id":153,"name":"RECEPTIONLIMITEDHOURS"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYENTERTAINMENT","id":5,"facilities":[{"id":4,"name":"INTERNETACCESS"},{"id":79,"name":"BOOKEXCHANGE"},{"id":95,"name":"BOARDGAMES"},{"id":106,"name":"CABLETV"},{"id":133,"name":"WIFI"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYFOODANDDRINKS","id":4,"facilities":[{"id":86,"name":"VENDINGMACHINES"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYKITCHEN","id":6,"facilities":[{"id":92,"name":"KITCHEN"},{"id":99,"name":"COOKER"},{"id":101,"name":"UTENSILS"},{"id":124,"name":"MICROWAVE"},{"id":360,"name":"POTSANDPANS"},{"id":361,"name":"SINK"},{"id":362,"name":"STOVE"},{"id":363,"name":"TOASTER"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYACCESSIBILITY","id":7,"facilities":[{"id":27,"name":"ELEVATOR"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYLAUNDRY","id":8,"facilities":[{"id":5,"name":"LAUNDRYFACILITIES"},{"id":102,"name":"DRYER"},{"id":131,"name":"WASHINGMACHINE"},{"id":368,"name":"FREEIRONIRONINGBOARD"},{"id":369,"name":"RECYCLINGBINS"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYWELLNESS","id":9,"facilities":[{"id":81,"name":"HOTSHOWERS"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYOUTDOORS","id":10,"facilities":[{"id":107,"name":"OUTDOORTERRACE"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYSAFETYANDSECURITY","id":11,"facilities":[{"id":14,"name":"LOCKERS"},{"id":375,"name":"CCTVINCOMMONAREAS"},{"id":376,"name":"FIREEXTINGUISHERS"},{"id":377,"name":"FIRSTAIDKITS"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYSOCIALAREAS","id":12,"facilities":[{"id":24,"name":"COMMONROOM"},{"id":380,"name":"LOUNGEROOM"},{"id":381,"name":"SOCIALBALCONY"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYBEDROOM","id":13,"facilities":[{"id":9,"name":"LINENINCLUDED"},{"id":132,"name":"TOWELSNOTINCLUDED"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYAVAILABLEFORAFEE","id":15,"facilities":[{"id":13,"name":"TOWELSFORHIRE"},{"id":37,"name":"BREAKFASTNOTINCLUDED"}]}],"images":[{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/z9rfbhbi364vpijnreyn","position":1},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/sjjerudjq0w0p3rklalm","position":2},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/ykghqhqhleols82i38qg","position":3},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/anhlgq9fz8xhtef7jl4d","position":4},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/gidpgcpsn46olcjvslxx","position":5},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/t8cnziu8n44svm2sx0gg","position":6},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/gl0iqyd8jzdezrpdsusm","position":7},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/g1ikbg1znuoul5ubwoxj","position":8},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/amiy1aya7hcabwvja2of","position":9},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/oxb6lj1vtgtwigwuynsj","position":10},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/tpzkcxyfwpmgvsglyrt3","position":11},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/hexqdxvs9wygbxzuah3n","position":12},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/dltkgylg985ebrak8qfx","position":13},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/dprgdoktreuzn19ndjsu","position":14},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/k2qxiev3e85ncaapweb7","position":15},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/tljj5w5dpjamgnbbuw3r","position":16},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/y6yodwhgbll9lmz0fzly","position":17},{"prefix":"a
